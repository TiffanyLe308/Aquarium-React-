        We hope to provide professional and accurate information so please don’t hesitate to drop us a line. From personal experience we have created many aquariums over the past decade,
        many of which are aquascapes, planted and rare or exotic species tanks. We specialise in all types of Aquaria knowledge and have attempted most things first hand.
        Technology continues to grow in the aquarium industry and so does our knowledge, aquariums are soon becoming one of the most popular hobbies and pets,
        due to their association with modern day peace and the joy of having a fragile ecosystem in the palm of your hands.<br/>
